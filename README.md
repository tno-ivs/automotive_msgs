This repository provides various messages created at [TNO](http://tno.nl)'s [Integrated Vehicle Safety](https://www.tno.nl/en/collaboration/expertise/technical-sciences/research-on-integrated-vehicle-safety/) section for working with [Robot Operating System (ROS)](http://www.ros.org).

## Warning!
The constants are different from the kinetic-devel branch. Upgrading your code to melodic might break backwards compatibiltiy.
